# openCV personal documentation 

Welcome to Davids personal openCV docs. 
I made this to learn the basics of openCV. In this section it is all about how to capture elements. Below I will try to document how to capture a video stream from the webcam, how to feed images and videos into openCV and eventually, how to capture a livestream from a drone. 

## basic common setup 

Obviously, we need to import openCV first. 
Confusingly, openCV is called cv2 during setup and install. 
Naturally, this means we can grab it with ``` pip install cv2 ``` and in the file import it with ``` import cv2 as cv ```.
